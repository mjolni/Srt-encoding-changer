# Srt-encoding-changer

Please notice - highly primitive script tested on Windows-1250 and Unicode encoded files. If you want to recode from other sets, please change input encoding in .ps1 file
Use on your own risk :-) - you were warned.

Simple Powershell Encoding Changer.

Put the .ps1 and .bat file to the parent directory where the subtitles are placed. Run the .bat file.
It searches for all .srt files in parent directory recursively.
Files found are recoded to unicode and saved under the same name.
